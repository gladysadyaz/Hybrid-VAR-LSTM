# Hybrid-VAR-LSTM
A comparative study on VAR and hybrid VAR-LSTM models for predicting international tourist arrivals to Bali and the IDR/USD exchange rate. The project uses a sliding window approach to determine optimal lag and performs hyperparameter tuning for the LSTM. The goal is to evaluate whether combining VAR and LSTM improves forecasting accuracy compared to using VAR individual.
